# Streamlit Secrets Configuration

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy the template to create your own secrets file:
   ```
   cp secrets.toml.template secrets.toml
   ```

2. Add your actual API keys and credentials to the `secrets.toml` file.

3. The `secrets.toml` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to the repository.

## Purpose

This configuration allows the application to access various APIs and services while keeping credentials secure.
